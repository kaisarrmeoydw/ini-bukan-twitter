            Not Twitter is a frontend for Bluesky and AT Protocol. It is not
            Twitter, X, Bluesky, or your personal data server. This policy
            explains what this app code does by default and what may happen when
            a particular deployment hosts it.

        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Information We Do Not Intentionally Collect'>
          <p>
            This codebase does not include a separate first-party social graph
            database, advertising pixel, analytics package, or payment system.
            It does not ask for your Bluesky password during the normal OAuth
            sign-in flow. If a deployment adds extra services, the operator
            should update this policy before collecting that additional data.

        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Browser Storage'>
          <p>
            Not Twitter uses browser storage instead of advertising cookies for
            local app state. Browser storage can include OAuth state, the active
            account identifier, saved account summaries, theme, accent color,
            and cached app preferences. Anyone with access to your browser
            profile, device, extensions, or developer tools may be able to view
            local data stored for this site.
          </p>
        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='How Information Is Shared'>
          <PrivacyList items={sharingCases} />
          <p>
            Not Twitter does not sell personal information in this codebase and
            does not include cross-context behavioral advertising by default.
          </p>
        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Public Content'>
          <p>
            Bluesky posts, profiles, likes, reposts, follows, lists, and other
            public AT Protocol data may remain visible outside this app after
            they are published. Deleting or changing content in Not Twitter
            sends the related request to Bluesky or your personal data server,
            but copies may still exist in caches, embeds, relays, feeds, search
            indexes, backups, or services controlled by other people.

        <PrivacySection title='Your Choices'>
          <PrivacyList items={choices} />
        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Children'>
          <p>
            Not Twitter is not directed to children under 13. Bluesky and your
            personal data server may have their own age rules for account
            creation and use.
          </p>
        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Security'>
          <p>
            The app uses AT Protocol OAuth where available and relies on
            Bluesky, your personal data server, browser storage, and the
            deployment host for key parts of security. No internet service can
            guarantee perfect security, so use a trusted device and sign out
            when you are finished on shared hardware.
          </p>
        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Changes'>
          <p>
            This policy may change as Not Twitter changes. Material updates
            should be reflected by changing the date at the top of the policy.
          </p>
        </PrivacySection>

        <PrivacySection title='Contact'>
          <p>
            For privacy questions about a specific deployment, contact the
            person or organization that provided that deployment. For the source
